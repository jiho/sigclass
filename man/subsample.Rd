\title{Feature-based subsampling of signals}
\usage{
subsample(x, p, k = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame/matrix of signals}

\item{p}{proportion of the total number of signals to subsample, between 0 and 1}

\item{k}{number of groups}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing picked and not-picked signals
}
\description{
Perform a partition of signals based on their characteristics and pick signals homogeneously across groups. This increases the probability of picking rare and different signals, which means that signals in the subsample are more representative of all signal types in the original data.
